    <h1><span class="orange">Problem 2:</span> Caesar Cipher (1 point)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      The Caesar cipher is a (<em>very</em> outdated...) method of encryption that uses a key, also known as a shift, to encrypt messages.
              <br />
              To encrypt any letter of the alphabet, you simply add the shift to it. For example, with a shift of <code>3</code>, <code>a</code> becomes <code>a + 3</code> which is <code>d</code>, <code>b</code> becomes <code>e</code>, etc. <a href="https://github.com/OKStateACM/CryptoWorkshop/blob/master/Notes_draft.md">Some more info on the notes from our cryptography workshop</a>
              <br />
              Brutus wants to figure out what key Caesar most commonly uses. He somehow has access to several messages and their encrypted counterparts. <strong>Write a program to help Brutus figure out what key was used to encrypt a certain message.</strong>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      <strong>Input 1:</strong> a plaintext String
      <br />
      <strong>Input 2:</strong> another string that is the encrypted form of Input1
      <br />
      <strong>Output:</strong> The key used to encrypt Input 1 into Input 2

      <h2>Constraints</h2>
      Assume that only letters <code>a</code>-<code>z</code> will be in the input. No need to worry about punctuation or capital letters.
      <br />
      The encryption scheme wraps around, i.e. <code>z + 3 = c</code>, <code>c + 25 = b</code>, <code>z + 20 = t</code>
      <br />
      You can assume that Input 2 will always be the correct encrypted form of Input 1.
      <br />
      <strong>Note: </strong> The ASCII range for <code>a</code>-<code>z</code> starts with <code>a</code> at 97. If you want to work with <code>a</code>-<code>z</code> as 1-26 subtract 96 from the char.
      <br />

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      <strong>Plaintext:</strong> <kbd>gopokes</kbd>
      <br />
      <strong>Encrypted text:</strong> <kbd>ltutpjx</kbd>

      Assume that BB-8 starts at the bottom left of the cavern and needs to get to the top right where the exit is. BB-8 can only move to the right or up (that is, cannot move left or down). Going into each room has a cost associated with it. The goal is to to get BB-8 out of the cavern while minimizing the cost.

    <h1><span class="orange">Problem 9: On The Grid (What the Funge?)</span> (20 points)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge</a> is an esoteric programming language that
      uses a grid system. It was designed specifically to be the hardest programming language to write
      a compiler for. The Befunge code itself is read in and treated like a grid, with the character at each
      cell representing a different operator. The interpreter starts at the top left <code>(0, 0)</code>,
      runs the instruction, then moves right (unless told otherwise) and runs the instruction at that cell.
      A <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fungeoid">fungeoid</a> is any language that is in the Befunge family.
      It must use a grid system like Befunge does. We have defined a simple fungeoid of which the
      permitted operations are listed below.
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <tr>
          <td><code>R</code></td>
          <td>Start moving right (east)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>L</code></td>
          <td>Start moving left (west)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>U</code></td>
          <td>Start moving up (north)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>D</code></td>
          <td>Start moving down (south)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>0</code>-<code>9</code></td>
          <td>Push this number onto the stack</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>"</code></td>
          <td><strong>Start string mode:</strong> push each character's ASCII value onto the stack all the way up until the next <code>"</code>.
              (This is instead of doing any operations implied by these characters,
              e.g. processing a <code>U</code> while in string mode means pushing <code>U</code>'s ASCII value onto the stack
              without a change in direction)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>P</code></td>
          <td>Pop value from the stack and output as ASCII character</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>_</code></td>
          <td><strong>no op:</strong> proceed to next cell without doing anything</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>J</code></td>
          <td><strong>One-time jump: </strong>Pop a value off the stack which becomes <em>x</em>. Pop another value off the stack which becomes <em>y</em>. Move to cell (x,y) and proceed execution. If you return to the cell in which the <code>J</code> instruction was originally executed, do not execute it again.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Q</code></td>
          <td>Stop Execution</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      Each one of these operations would exist inside a cell on the grid system. An example code snippet
      would be:
      <div class="well">
        R"a"_PD
        <br />
        Q_J00_L
      </div>
      It's a good idea to visualize this as a grid:
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <td>R</td>
          <td>"</td>
          <td>a</td>
          <td>"</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>P</td>
          <td>D</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Q</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>J</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>L</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>Execution starts at <code>(0, 0)</code> with <code>R</code>. This tells the interpreter
        to start moving right. (This isn't actually necessary right now, since execution should move
        to the right by default, but it's important for later.)</li>
        <li>Moving to the right, the next cell contains <code>"</code> which tells the interpreter
        to enter string mode. Execution continues to move to the right.</li>
        <li>The next cell contains an <code>a</code>. Since it is in string mode,
            the ASCII value of <code>a</code> is pushed onto the stack.</li>
        <li>The next cell contains <code>"</code>, which ends string mode.</li>
        <li>The next cell is a no op, nothing happens and the interpreter moves right one</li>
        <li>The next cell contains an operation, <code>P</code>, which tells the interpreter
        to pop the top value off of the stack and print it to stdout.</li>
        <li>Still moving to the right, the next cell contains an operation <code>D</code>, which
        tells the interpreter to start moving down the grid cell by cell.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves down one cell. The operation in this cell is <code>L</code>,
        which tells the interpreter to start moving left cell by cell.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves to the left one cell. The <code>_</code> in this cell represents
        a "no op", meaning nothing will happen, and the interpreter will continue moving
        in the direction it was previously.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves left one cell. The <code>0</code> in this cell tells the interpreter
        to push a <code>0</code> onto the stack.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves left one cell and again pushs <code>0</code> to the stack.</li>
        <li>The interpreter once again moves left one cell. The <code>J</code> operation
        tells the interpreter to pop a value from the stack, call it <code>x</code>, pop
        the next value from the stack, call it <code>y</code>, and move to <code>(x, y)</code>.
        In this case, since the last two values pushed to the stack were <code>0</code>
        and <code>0</code>, the interpreter will move to <code>(0, 0)</code>.</li>
        <li>It will go back to <code>(0, 0)</code>. The direction the interpreter was moving before the J
        operation was <strong>left</strong>, so after moving to <code>(0, 0)</code> and executing that command it should move left one cell.
        <strong>However, </strong>the operation in cell <code>(0, 0)</code> is <code>R</code>, which tells the interpreter to start moving <strong>right</strong> cell by cell</li>
        <li>Execution will therefore move to the right, and everything will be the same as before. <strong>until...</strong></li>
        <li>When the interpreter reaches the J instruction, it should not execute it, and execution should continue moving.</li>
        <li>Moving left again, the interpreter encounters a <code>_</code>(no op), and then a <code>Q</code>, which stops execution</li>
      </ul>
