      <b>Given an input read from stdin, print it backwards and diagonally.</b>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>

    <h1>Problem 2: Caesar Cipher (3 points)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      The caesar cipher is a (very outdated...) method of encryption that uses a key, also known as a shift, to encrypt messages.
              <br />
              To encrypt any letter of the alphabet, you simply add the shift to it. For example, with a shift of <code>3</code>, <code>a</code> becomes <code>a + 3</code> which is <code>d</code>, <code>b</code> becomes <code>e</code>, etc. <a href="https://github.com/OKStateACM/CryptoWorkshop/blob/master/Notes_draft.md">Some more info on the notes from our cryptography workshop</a>
              <br />
              Brutus wants to figure out what key Caesar most commonly uses. He somehow has access to several messages and their encrypted counterparts. <b>Write a program to help Brutus figure out what key was used to encrypt a certain message.</b>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input1: a plaintext String
      <br />
      Input2: another string that is the encrypted form of Input1
      <br />
      Output: The key used to encrypt Input1 into Input2
      <hr />
      Assume that only letters a-z will be in the input. No need to worry about punctuation or capital letters.
      <hr />
      The encryption scheme wraps around, i.e. <code>z + 3 = c</code>, <code>c + 25 = b</code>, <code>z + 20 = t</code>
      <hr />
      You can assume that Input2 will always be the correct encrypted form of Input1.
      <hr />
      <b>Note: </b> The ascii range for a-z starts with a at 97. If you want to work with a-z as 1-26 subtract 96 from the char.
      <br />

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      Plain text: <kbd>gopokes</kbd>
      <br />
      Encrypted text: <kbd>ltutpjx</kbd>

    <h1>Problem 4: 2D Palindromes (6 points)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      A 2 dimensional array is a rectangular array of elements. The reverse image of a 2 dimensional array is defined to be the array reversed in both directions.
      For example, the reverse image of
      <div class="well">
        1 4 7

        8 5 2
        <br />
        7 4 1
      </div>
      A 2 dimensional array is said to be palindromic if there is no difference between it and it's reverse image.
      <b>Write a program that reads in a 2 dimensional array from a file whose filename is specified by either stdin or a command line argument, and checks to see if that 2 dimensional array is palindromic</b>

      Input: File name of a file containing a 2 dimensional array (either parsed as a command line argument or read from stdin)
      <br />
      File: The file should contain a 2 dimensional array of elements, where each row is a line, and each element in each row is seperated by a space.
      <br />
      Output: A message stating whether or not that 2 dimensional array is palindromic.

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      File Name to Read: <kbd>2darray.txt</kbd>

    <!-- TODO Show Grid System Better -->

    <h1>Problem 9: On The Grid (What the Funge?)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge">Befunge</a> is an esoteric programming language that
      uses a grid system. It was designed specifically to be the hardest programming language to write
      a compiler for. Each instruction is part of a grid. The interpreter starts at the top left <code>(0, 0)</code>,
      runs the instruction, then moves right(unless told otherwise) and runs the instruction at that cell.
      A <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Fungeoid">Fungeoid</a> is any language that is in the befunge family.
      It must use a grid system, like befunge does. We have defined a simple fungeoid of which the
      permitted operations are listed below.
      <table class="table table-striped">
        <tr>
          <td><code>R</code></td>
          <td>Start moving right</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>L</code></td>
          <td>Start moving left</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>U</code></td>
          <td>Start moving up</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>D</code></td>
          <td>Start moving down</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>0</code>-<code>9</code></td>
          <td>Push this number onto the stack</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>"</code></td>
          <td>Start string mode: push each character's ASCII value all the way up until the next "</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>P</code></td>
          <td>Pop value from the stack and output as ASCII character</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>_</code></td>
          <td><b>no op:</b> proceed to next cell without doing anything</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>J</code></td>
          <td><b>One time jump: </b>Pop a value off the stack which becomes x. Pop another value off the stack which becomes y. Move to cell (x,y) and proceed execution. If you return to the cell in which the J instruction was originally executed, do not execute it again.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><code>Q</code></td>
          <td>Stop Execution</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      Each one of these operations would exist inside a cell on the grid system. An example code snippet
      would be:
      <div class="well">
        R"a"_PD
        <br />
        Q_J00_L
      </div>
      It's a good idea to visualize this as a grid:
      <table class="table table-bordered">
        <tr>
          <td>R</td>
          <td>"</td>
          <td>a</td>
          <td>"</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>P</td>
          <td>D</td>
        </tr
        <tr>
          <td>Q</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>J</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>_</td>
          <td>L</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <ul>
        <li>Execution starts at <code>(0, 0)</code> with <code>R</code>. This tells the interpreter
        to start moving right. (This isn't actually necessary right now, since execution should move
        to the right by default, but it's important for later.)</li>
        <li>Moving to the right, the next cell contains <code>"</code> which tells the interpreter
        to enter string mode. Execution continues to move to the right.</li>
        <li>The next cell contains an 'a'. Since it is in string mode, the 'a' is pushed onto the stack.</li>
        <li>The next cell contains <code>"</code>, which terminates string mode.</li>
        <li>The next cell is a no op, nothing happens and the interpreter moves right one</li>
        <li>The next cell contains an operation, <code>P</code>, which tells the interpreter
        to pop the top value off of the stack and print it to stdout.</li>
        <li>Still moving to the right, the next cell contains an operation <code>D</code>, which
        tells the interpreter to start moving down the grid cell by cell.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves down one cell. The operation in this cell is <code>L</code>,
        which tells the interpreter to start moving left cell by cell.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves to the left one cell. The <code>_</code> in this cell represents
        a "no op", meaning nothing will happen, and the interpreter will continue moving
        in the direction it was previously.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves left one cell. The <code>0</code> in this cell tells the interpreter
        to push a <code>0</code> onto the stack.</li>
        <li>The interpreter moves left one cell and again pushs <code>0</code> to the stack.</li>
        <li>The interpreter once again moves left one cell. The <code>J</code> operation
        tells the interpreter to pop a value from the stack, call it <code>x</code>, pop
        the next value from the stack, call it <code>y</code>, and move to <code>(x, y)</code>.
        In this case, since the last two values pushed to the stack were <code>0</code>
        and <code>0</code>, the interpreter will move to <code>(0, 0)</code>.</li>
        <li>It will go back to <code>(0, 0)</code>. The direction the interpreter was moving before the J
        operation was <b>left</b>, so after moving to <code>(0, 0)</code> and executing that command it should move left one cell.
        <b>However, </b>the operation in cell <code>(0, 0)</code> is <code>R</code>, which tells the interpreter to start moving <b>right</b> cell by cell</li>
        <li>Execution will therefore move to the right, and everything will be the same as before. <b>until...</b></li>
        <li>When the interpreter reaches the J instruction, it should not execute it, and execution should continue moving.</li>
        <li>Moving left again, the interpreter encounters a <code>_</code>(no op), and then a <code>Q</code>, which stops execution</li>
      </ul>
