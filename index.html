        <h1>Problem 2: Caesar Cipher (3 points)</h1>
        <div class="well">
         The caesar cipher is a (very outdated...) method of encryption that uses a key, also known as a shift, to encrypt messages.
                  <br />
                  To encrypt any letter of the alphabet, you simply add the shift to it. For example, with a shift of <code>3</code>, <code>a</code> becomes <code>a + 3</code> which is <code>d</code>, <code>b</code> becomes <code>e</code>, etc. <a href="https://github.com/OKStateACM/CryptoWorkshop/blob/master/Notes_draft.md">Some more info on the notes from our cryptography workshop</a>
                  <br />
                  Brutus wants to figure out what key Caesar most commonly uses. He somehow has access to several messages and their encrypted counterparts. Write a program to help Brutus figure out what key was used to encrypt a certain message.

          <br />
          Output: The key used to encrypt Input1 into Input2
          <hr />
          Assume that only letters a-z will be in the input. No need to worry about punctuation or capital letters.
          <hr />
          The encryption scheme wraps around, i.e. <code>z + 3 = c</code>, <code>c + 25 = b</code>, <code>z + 20 = t</code>
          <hr />
          You can assume that Input2 will always be the correct encrypted form of Input1.
          <hr />
          <b>Note: </b> The ascii range for a-z starts with a at 97. If you want to work with a-z as 1-26 subtract 96 from the char.

    <h1>Problem 5: 2D Palindromes</h1>
    <div class="well">
      A 2 dimensional array is a rectangular array of elements. The reverse image of a 2 dimensional array is defined to be the array reversed in both directions.
      For example, the reverse image of
      <div class="well">
        1 4 7
        <br />
        2 5 8
        <br />

      is:
      <div class="well">
        9 6 3
        <br />
        8 5 2
        <br />
        7 4 1
      </div>
      A 2 dimensional array is said to be palindromic if there is no difference between it and it's reverse image.
      <b>Write a program that reads in a 2 dimensional array from a file, and checks to see if it is palindromic</b>

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input: File name of a file containing a 2 dimensional array, with elements seperated by spaces, rows seperated by lines.
      <br />
      Output: A message stating whether or not that 2 dimensional array is palindromic.

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      File Name to Read: <kbd>2darray.txt</kbd>
      <br />
      (where 2darray.txt looks like this):

        2 1 2

    <h1>Problem 6: Collatz</h1>
    <div class="well">
      The Collatz sequence is defined as:
      <div class="well">
        Start with any positive integer <code>n</code>.
        <br />
        if (3n + 1) is odd:
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;The next term in the sequence will be (3n + 1)
        <br />
        if (3n + 1) is even:
        <br />
         &nbsp;&nbsp;The next term in the sequence will be n/2
        <br />
        We do this until we reach one.
      </div>
      For example, the Collatz sequence of 3 is:
      <div class="well">
        3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1

      The length of the above Collatz sequence is 8

      <br />
      <b>Write a program that, when given a length, finds the smallest positive integer whose Collatz sequence is of that length</b>

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input: an integer n, representing a length.
      <br />
      Output: The smallest positive integer whose Collatz sequence is of that length.

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      Length: <kbd>3</kbd>
      <br />
      Smallest Positive Integer with Length 3: 4 
      <br />
      (because the collatz sequence of 4 is 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1, which is of length 3)
