          <li>All of OSU's academic integrity rules apply. You are free to use google/your friends so long as your code is your own.</li>
          <li>Unless the problem specifies otherwise, all input will be read from stdin (so, for java this means a Scanner reading System.in)</li>
          <li>You must be standing in line to pass your code off before 8:31 P.M. in order to get credit for the problem.</li>
          <li>If you come to one of the judges to pass off a program and it doesn't work, you may fix it and come back as many times as necessary, given it is still before 8:31 P.M.</li>

    <h1>Problem 2: Caesar Cipher (3 points)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      The caesar cipher is a (very outdated...) method of encryption that uses a key, also known as a shift, to encrypt messages.
              <br />
              To encrypt any letter of the alphabet, you simply add the shift to it. For example, with a shift of <code>3</code>, <code>a</code> becomes <code>a + 3</code> which is <code>d</code>, <code>b</code> becomes <code>e</code>, etc. <a href="https://github.com/OKStateACM/CryptoWorkshop/blob/master/Notes_draft.md">Some more info on the notes from our cryptography workshop</a>
              <br />
              Brutus wants to figure out what key Caesar most commonly uses. He somehow has access to several messages and their encrypted counterparts. <b>Write a program to help Brutus figure out what key was used to encrypt a certain message.</b>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input1: a plaintext String
      <br />
      Input2: another string that is the encrypted form of Input1
      <br />
      Output: The key used to encrypt Input1 into Input2
      <hr />
      Assume that only letters a-z will be in the input. No need to worry about punctuation or capital letters.
      <hr />
      The encryption scheme wraps around, i.e. <code>z + 3 = c</code>, <code>c + 25 = b</code>, <code>z + 20 = t</code>
      <hr />
      You can assume that Input2 will always be the correct encrypted form of Input1.
      <hr />
      <b>Note: </b> The ascii range for a-z starts with a at 97. If you want to work with a-z as 1-26 subtract 96 from the char.
      <br />

      <h2>Example Run</h2>
      Plain text: <kbd>gopokes</kbd>
      <br />
      Encrypted text: <kbd>ltutpjx</kbd>
      <br />
      Key Used: 5

    <h1>Problem 3: The rorrim mirror (3 points)</h1>
    <div class="well">
      <b>Given an integer n, and a list of n words, print out n lines. Each line should have one of the words from the list, first printed backwards, then printed forwards, with one space inbetween. On any given line, there must be enough leading spaces so that the first character of the words line up on the printout.</b>
      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input: Integer n, followed by n words

        8 5 2
        <br />
        7 4 1
      </div>
      A 2 dimensional array is said to be palindromic if there is no difference between it and it's reverse image.
      <b>Write a program that reads in a 2 dimensional array from a file whose filename is specified by either stdin or a command line argument, and checks to see if that 2 dimensional array is palindromic</b>

      <h2>Specifications</h2>
      Input: File name of a file containing a 2 dimensional array (either parsed as a command line argument or read from stdin)
      <br />
      File: The file should contain a 2 dimensional array of elements, where each row is a line, and each element in each row is seperated by a space.
      <br />
      Output: A message stating whether or not that 2 dimensional array is palindromic.

      <h2>Example Run</h2>

    <h1>BB-8's Dilemna</h1>
    <div class="well">
      The droid BB-8 got stuck in a cavern. You need to help BB-8 get out. You know that the cavern is flat and consists of N "rooms". You also know that there are H*W number of rooms, where H is the height of the cavern and W is the width of the cavern. Assume that each "room" takes up one space.
      <br />
      <br />
      Assume that BB-8 starts at the bottom left of the cavern and needs to get to the top right where the exit is. BB-8 can only move to the right or up (that is, cannot move left or down). Going into each room has a cost associated with it. The goal is to to get BB-8 out of the cavern while minimizing the cost.
