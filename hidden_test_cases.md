    ```
      sananab bananas
    etalocohc chocolate
     zartakla alkatraz
    ```

## Problem 4
  - This will be a bit hard, since you will need to edit files. Just make sure you type everything down correctly.

  - Input File:
    ```
    0 4 5 6
    1 2 3 4
    4 3 2 1
    7 5 4 0
    ```
    Output: Yes, this is palindromic

  - Input File:
    ```
    0 5 5 9
    1 8 7 3
    0 9 8 2
    5 4 3 1
    ```
    Output: No, this is not palindromic

## Problem 5
  - Test with n = 701408733 as well as two other random values of n from the attached file

## Problem 6
  - Test with n = 300 as well as two other random values of n from the attached file

## Problem 7
  - TBD

## Problem 8
  - TBD

## Problem 9
  - Again, this one will be time consuming to judge. Thankfully it's designed so you probably won't have to do it often. Just make sure you type everything down correctly.
  
  - **NOTE**: Do not include the spaces I put between each charater, that is just used to better tell how many underscores there are

  - Input File:
  ```
  R " a p p l e s " D
  Q _ _ P P P P P P L
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  selppa
  ```

  - Input File (There is just one space between the "", sorry it's kind of confusing):
  ```
  R D _ P "   " L _ _
  _ R _ _ _ _ _ _ D _
  D " h e l l o " L _
  R P P P P P 0 7 J Q
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  hello hello
  ```
